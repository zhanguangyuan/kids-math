        <h2 class="text-5xl text-center font-extrabold">Your goal is to defend the heart from all attackers. Click on an open circle to place a turret for 100 gold.
          It will automatically fire at any incoming numbers.Later on, you'll need to upgrade your turrets. Click on a turret to open the upgrade panel.
          Here, you can buy extra numbers and math operators to increase its damage output. After you buy them, click and drag to arrange them into a mathematical equation.
          For example, if your turret is at 1 attack power, you can buy a plus sign and a 1 to increase its attack power to 2.
          Some enemies can only be defeated by turrets that match their color. Your turret's color is always set by whichever mathematical operator it is using the most.
          For example, if you have 2 yellow minus signs and 1 blue plus sign in your formula, then the turret will be yellow. Before a new wave starts,
          you can see a preview of which enemy types are coming at the top of the screen.</h2>

          Super Number Defense is a tower-defense game that uses math to improve the defensive capabilities of turret-style towers.
          A young student bored with class falls asleep and dreams that they must defend a red heart on a grid-paper background with towers that shoot balls at enemies shaped
          like math symbols. They need the player's help with selecting the correct combinations of numbers and symbols to perform math equations that upgrade the strength
          of each ball shot from a turret against enemy waves across 14 levels.

          The player earns golden objects that convert into points by destroying enemies. They also earn points by watching ads.
          They use the points to upgrade each 1-point tower to a higher damage level. The symbol needed for an equation associated with a particular tower
          is based on the enemy's symbol during a wave. The game displays the symbol or symbols at the top center of the screen.

          For example, if the game displays a blue plus sign, the player uses a plus sign to create an addition equation with the highest possible result,
          such as 3 + 3 = 6. If the game displays an orange minus sign, they create a subtraction equation, such as 3 - 1 = 2.

          Super Number Defense allows the player to sell numbers already on the grid to make room for numbers that offer better damage outcomes. For example,
          the player can sell a 1 to start over with an equation that features the highest available number

          The player can slow down or speed up the action to give the towers less or more time to complete a defense.
          Slowing down a wave or battle gives the player more time to destroy enemies and perform tower upgrades.
