          <h3 class="p3">In Number Merge you must collect the biggest numbers and go through all the walls! Sounds simple, doesn't it?
            Control your number by finding the optimal path and avoiding all obstacles. Absorb the smaller numbers and become bigger and stronger.
            Reach the finish line and get the maximum number of points - it's time to test your agility in this exciting game!</h3>
          <p style="font-size: 18px; color: #000000"  class="p4">
            You start the game with a small number. During the race, merge with other numbers that are smaller than yours,
            they are painted in green. Try not to collide with red numbers that are bigger than yours. Otherwise,
            you will lose your number and you will have to restart the level. Jump over ditches, cross bridges and avoid chainsaws.
            At the finish line, you will face many walls. Knock down the walls one by one with your big number and become a master of numbers!
