        Hi Parents! We are glad you found this website. Hopefully, the math worksheets on this website can be of some help to your child in his or her acquisition of basic math facts.
      </h3>

     <h2  class="text-5xl text-center font-extrabold">Helping Your Child Learn Math</h2>

     <h3 class="aboutstyle">
       Math worksheets are not magic; they will not teach math; this is the job of your child, you, and your child's teacher.
       The math worksheets on Kids-Drills.com are an excellent resource for you and your child. Here are some ideas that you might find useful in helping your child learn math.
     </h3>

       <li class="aboutstyle">Check out Helping your Child Learn Mathematics from the U.S. Department of Education.</li>
       <li class="aboutstyle">Establish reasonable homework times (like their age plus five minutes for younger children, and up to 60 minutes for older children).</li>
       <li class="aboutstyle">Provide a distraction-free learning environment (turn off the television and radio, provide good lighting, turn on the answering machine, etc.)</li>
       <li class="aboutstyle">Use Math-Drills.Com worksheets to practice math skills on a regular basis. One idea is to use math worksheets when your child has no homework. That way they maintain the good habit of doing homework, and practice math skills at the same time.</li>
       <li class="aboutstyle">If your child doesn't know some math skills, use every possible method you can think of until you find the one that works for him or her. Some ideas: flashcards, games (including computer games), paper and pencil methods, memorization, and out-loud thinking.</li>
       <li class="aboutstyle">Ask your child's teacher for some specific strategies to help you help your child.</li>

     <h3  class="aboutstyle">
     If you happen to be one of many parents who has a struggling student, there are options for you out there.
     If you can afford it, tutors focus on your child's individual needs and teach them mastery of skills they may have missed in school for whatever reason.
     There is a reason why tutoring centers guarantee that your child will get ahead...
     because they fill in the learning gaps that are holding them back without getting into any new material until those learning gaps are addressed.
     </h3>

     <h3  class="aboutstyle">
       If tutoring is not an option, you can often get extra help through your school.
       There is often extra support available for those who know how to ask the right questions and have done their research.
       Look into your country's or state/province/county's legislation related to education,
       talk to other parents or join parent groups, talk to your child's teacher, the special education teacher, the principal,
       search the Internet for ideas of support that is available, "get the ball rolling" as soon as you can, so your child gets the support they need sooner than later.
     </h3>

     <h3  class="aboutstyle">
       If you are a homeschooler, network with other homeschoolers and ask them for ideas. Look on homeschooler websites for ideas and resource materials. Ask questions;
       people are often willing to share their expertise if they are asked.

       Parenting is a difficult job, "May the road rise up to meet you. May the wind always be at your back."

                      Math is a universal language. Regardless of your culture or your dialect two plus two equals four. That is why we like math;
                      it is one of the only things out there that everyone agrees on;
                      outside of theoretical math of course.</p>

                    <p class="p4">
                      Educational publishers charge a great deal for this type of work,
                      so we thought everyone would welcome a super low cost; highly useful source.
                      Since we started this little project many of our past colleagues have shared plenty of great ideas and materials.
                      We hope you enjoy the work and let me know how you feel about.
                      We are constantly working to make it better. We add new materials all the time.
